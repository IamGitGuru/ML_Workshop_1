# Machine Learning Workshop 1 : Introduction to Machine Learning

This workshop is presented to you by [ECAST -Electronics and computer Community Amidist Students, Thapathali](https://github.com/ecastthapathali) in coordination with [Tensor, IOE Thapathali](https://github.com/tensor-ioe). This workshop aims to introduce machine learning among students and young professionals, providing them with the foundational knowledge and skills necessary to understand and apply machine learning techniques in real-world scenarios.

Throughout this session, we will cover key machine learning concepts, including data preprocessing, supervised learning algorithms, evaluation metrics, and practical examples of how to implement machine learning models using popular tools and libraries. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a clearer understanding of how machine learning works, its applications in various fields, and how to develop their own machine learning models for different tasks.

## Objectives:

- Understand the fundamental concepts of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Gain practical experience in implementing basic machine learning algorithms using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, pandas and Scikit-learn.
- Learn how to preprocess data, split datasets, and evaluate models using appropriate metrics.
- Be introduced to the real-world applications of machine learning and how to tackle problems like classification, regression, and clustering.

## Practice Labs :

This repo contains practice labs for every day of workshop. Labs of next day will be provided the day before.

### How to access lab ?

1. clone this repository

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tensor-ioe/ML_Workshop_1.git

   ```

2. Update the new labs the day before as :
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

new updates will be automatically added to your existing files

### How to submit the assaignments ?

1. Fork this repository into your github account.

2. clone your forked repository as

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_github_username/forked_repo_name.git
   replace `your_github_username`and` forked_repo_name` with your username and the name of your repository name.

   ```

3. create a new branch with your name and clz roll number

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your_name_class_roll_number
   Replace `your_name_class_roll_number` with your actual name and class roll number.

   ```

4. Make your changes or complete the assignment in this branch.

5. commit your changes
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Completed Assignment of Day-n"
   ```
6. Push your changes to your forked repository
   ```bash
   git push origin your_name_class_roll_number
   ```
7. Create a Pull Request from your forked repository to this repository.

> Note : you can directly sync new available labs into your forked repository

> This repository will be archived after this workshop
